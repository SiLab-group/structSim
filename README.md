Framework for automated simulation to analyze adaptive systems

The Structured Simulation Framework was created for automated simulation to analyze adaptive systems. 

This project is a RCSO project lead by the Si-Lab group of the Institute of Informaiton Systems of the HES-SO Valais/Wallis in Sierre, Switzerland.  

 
To use our framework to your project you have to add the "structSimV1.jar" to your project. 

A tutorial (structSimTutorial.pdf) is available to help you to begin with our framework. Some example are also described in this tutorial.
